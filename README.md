## To Do
- As per Dr. Gaynor (6/1/2015):
	- Hospital has two types of rooms: ICU and Regular rooms.
	- Often, it costs more money to build MANY ICU rooms than actually needed.
	- Therefore, we need to build rooms that are adjsutable (ICU/regular at the same time).
	- The question is: How many rooms should be designed as adjustable?
	- In order to decide on that (for now), Dr. Gaynor requested:
		- A graphical design of the hospital showing both types of rooms. 
		- With, a virtual simulation (animation) to show patients flowing in/out of rooms.
		- **P.S.**: for a similar **CASE** and **SOFTWARE** [see this](https://www.simulationsoftware.com/content.php/195-Hospital-Simulation).

- ~~Get to work on a real dataset.~~
- ~~Search for public Dataset. [see](support/public-datasets.html)~~
- ~~Set a response time/serve time for every patient.~~
