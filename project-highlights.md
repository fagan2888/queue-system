# Simulation of Hospital Management System using Evidence-Based Design

##

**definion:**
Evidence-based design, or EBD, is a field of study emphasizing credible evidence to influence design. This approach has become popular in healthcare to improve patient and staff well-being, patient healing, stress reduction and safety.

###Selling an Evidence-Based Design for Waterford Hospital
<a href="http://www.ache.org/pdf/secure/gifts/McAlearney%20(2224)%20Cases-gift-FInal.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> highlights


- page 1: Campeon Health is a Midwestern healthcare system composed of five hospitals, ten affiliated hospitals, and an extensive ambulatory care network.


- page 2: Evidence-based design is increasingly being used by hospitals that are try- ing to improve staff morale, patients’ experiences, and the outcomes of care provided.


- page 2: Evidence-based healthcare designs are specifically used to create environments that are therapeutic, supportive of family involvement, efficient for staff performance, and restorative for workers under stress.


- page 3: In healthcare, the application of evidence-based design is particularly appropriate.


- page 3: Hospitals themselves have been shown to benefit economically from reduced costs and increased organizational effectiveness when applying the principles of evidence-based design


- page 3: Evidence-based design principles include many elements of building design,


- page 3: Another promising feature of evidence-based design is the potential for well-designed rooms and buildings to improve clinical outcomes.


- page 4: A key component of evidence-based design in hospitals is the acuity-adaptable room.


- page 4: Acuity-adaptable rooms are private rooms that are composed of a pa- tient area, a staff area, and a family area.


- page 4: An acuity-adaptable room design helps solve some of the problems with bottlenecks in patient flow that occur daily in most hospitals.


- page 4: Within traditional hospitals, patient flow revolves around nursing units, which are generally organized by diagnosis type.


- page 4: Diagnosis type is, in turn, influenced by three factors: (1) the headwall capability to ac- commodate lines and gases, (2) the clinical skills of the nurse to treat different levels of acuity, and (3) the historically variable reimbursement from the Cen- ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services


- page 5: Improvements in clinical and patient satisfaction outcomes associated with the introduction of acuity-adaptable rooms were starting to be documented.


- page 5: Humphries was intrigued by two examples


- page 5: These examples are described in “Examples of Acuity-Adaptable Models in US Hospitals.”


- page 5: Another opportunity that has emerged out of the principles of evidence-based design is to develop decentralized nurse stations.


- page 5: A typical nursing unit has a central nurse station with the rooms laid out in a double corridor rectangular pattern around the nurse station.


- page 6: Examples of Acuity-Adaptable Models in US Hospitals


- page 6: An Acuity-Adaptable Comprehensive Critical Coronary Care Floor at Clarian Health


- page 6: An Acuity-Adaptable Model Implemented at Celebration Health


- page 7: Evidence-based design options such as acuity-adaptable rooms and decen- tralized nurse stations have tremendous potential to improve the quality of patient care, but there are also substantial challenges associated with implementation.


- page 7: staffing using an acuity-adaptable model of care can be difficult


- page 7: Nurses tend to practice within a specialty because they enjoy the specialty.


- page 7: Technology can help overcome some of the challenges


- page 8: Construction costs per square foot for an evidence-based design building are not much higher than for a traditional building,


- page 9: Humphries is convinced that an evidence-based design model will be appropriate for the design of Waterford Hospital.


- page 9: Overall, Humphries is pleased with the preliminary plans for Waterford Hospital, but she knows she has a long way to go to convince hospital staff and physicians accustomed to working in traditional hospital environments that the evidence-based design model is sound and desirable.
