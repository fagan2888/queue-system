## To Do

Python application to:

- collect patients' data logs (e.g. in - duration - out of the hospital):
    - name, arrival, departure, service time
    - number of patients serviced at the same time
    - number of rooms available at a given time.

- for simulation purpose we will generate imaginary (fake) patients data.

- provide predictive analysis based on the patients data.
