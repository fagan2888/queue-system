## To Do

- Apply Poisson distribution for the arrival process.
- Provide predictive analysis based on the patients data.
- Get to work on a real dataset.
- Search for public Dataset.
- âˆš The total number of patients in the hospital at a given day (and how many IN / OUT on that day). [see](http://shrib.com/PRgKminG?hide=35)

## Keywords:

- Queuing theory (systems) in healthcare.
- Poisson distribution (probability, process).
- queuing system Poisson, see [1](https://www.google.com/#q=queuing+system+poisson+inurl:.edu), [2](https://www.google.com/#q=queuing+system+poisson+)

## To Answer:

- What kind of prediction, estimation, or operations do we need to perform on the datasets ?
- Can we have real datasets?
